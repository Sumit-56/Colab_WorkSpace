# Colab Notebooks for Data Exploration, Manipulation & Time Series (R & Python)

This repository contains a collection of Google Colab notebooks focused on **data exploration**, **data manipulation**, and **time series analysis**, implemented using both **R** and **Python** programming languages. The goal is to provide hands-on, practical examples that demonstrate core concepts in data science and statistics.

These notebooks are ideal for:
- Students and learners studying data science or statistics
- Researchers working with real-world datasets
- Professionals interested in practical implementations
- Anyone looking to enhance their skills in R or Python

## What's Inside?

- Data Exploration and Cleaning (R & Python)
- Time Series Analysis (trend, seasonality, forecasting)
- Data Transformation and Manipulation using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `pandas`, etc.
- Visualizations using `ggplot2`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Real-life datasets and use cases

## Tools and Technologies

- Google Colab
- R (with tidyverse, forecast, etc.)
- Python (with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)
- Open-source datasets
